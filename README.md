* Start the Solution YABM (PJ YABM.API)in debug.
* The port the Web api runs on might vary on your system, the swagger page should open and give you the port once you try the get boats call.
* Check that the port variable has the port value expected in the file : boat-service.ts ( this manual port check could be avoided with a docker compose.)
* Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
* Navigate to the YABM.client folder with a console.
* npm install
* npm start
